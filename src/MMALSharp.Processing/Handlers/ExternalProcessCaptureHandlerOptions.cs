        // a corrupt video file (for example, MP4 encoding will be missing the end-header MOOV atom).
        // Testing also shows it doesn't help to delay between sending the signals.
        //
        // Termination signal combos tested include SIGINT followed by:
        //    SIGINT, SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGTERM, SIGHUP - immediate stop, no output of any kind
        //    SIGQUIT - ouputs a message, tries to write trailer (MOOV atom), aborts
        //
        // Certain simpler video formats like AVI may either complete successfully, or at least play
        // without obvious issues but they are still likely to be "technically" corrupted at the end.
